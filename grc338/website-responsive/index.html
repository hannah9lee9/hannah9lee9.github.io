         <h2 class="yellow">For the coffee and art fanatics</h2>
         <p class="homepage">Located in the heart of San Luis Obispo, Magnolia Coffee evokes the charm of an old-world caf√© and the whimsy of a bohemian art gallery. Magnolia Coffee prides itself in partnership. Partnership looks like partnership with the community and partnership of complementary expression forms in food, art, and music.</p>
         <p class="homepage">Originally built as a coffee roasting facility in 1933, the iconic Art Deco landmark has gradually evolved to become a watering hole and creative venue for locals, tourists, and artists. Several times a month, the drink, food, and art fare is coupled with live music.</p>
         <p>What is a better way to spend an evening?</p>
         <h2 class="yellow">Join the Magnolia Coffee family!</h2>
