            <p>We are an obsessively researched skincare brand that uses only the most effective and essential ingredients. We make skincare that works.</p>
            <p>Driven by boundless scientific curiosity to figure out how skin works and what skincare products actually do, our founders Emily and Hannah obsessively read dermatology journals. Inspired by a particular study about cermindes and fatty acids, they decided to start formulating their own skincare and blogged about their findings.</p>
            <p>Their initial idea was simple: to create a gentle and effective moisturizer based on this study that worked with the skin to replenish and reinforce it on a biological level. No fragrance, no fillers, just a formula that truly worked.</p>
            <p>After a lot of trial and error, they perfected the formula for their moisturizer. This eventually came to be known as Generation Skins’s best seller, Moisture Lock.</p>
            <p>Fast forward to today, Emily and Hannah are still researching and testing out new product ideas but committed to expanding a new branch in Generation Skin: accessible dermatology. They work alongisde local skin experts to continue providing answers and resources to your skincare questions.</p>
